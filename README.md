## Phone Box Project

### Description
for this assignment, Myself and two partners of mine were asked to make abox that allowed a phone to be out of sight but safe.

### Reflection
This assignment was a good exercise in reminding myself and my partners how Onshape worked. Our Solenoid ended up wired wrong and overheated resulting in a failed lock for the box. Pther than that our project went really well.

## Swing Arm

### Description

for this assignment I was given a chart on some of the dimensions and was asked to make a swing arm

)


### Reflection

This was a difficult assignment and I had to do it with Mr. Helmstetters help outside of class during Bacon. However now that I have finished it I learned a lot more about constraints and other tools in Onshape. This would prove very usefull for the cetification exam which had a very similer part to it.

### Reflection
This assignment was a litlle more difficult then the previous one but not too hard and I learned a lot more about CPython. I mainly used my knowledge on how a servo is coded in Arduino and translated it into CPython. This assignment was very helpful in learning more about CPython.



## CircuitPython_LCD

### Description & Code
This assignment we need to print numbers on an LCD that can count up and down using buttons.
```# get and i2c object
i2c = board.I2C()
btn = DigitalInOut(board.D3)
btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D4)
btn.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn.pull = Pull.UP
# some LCDs are 0x3f... some are 0x27.
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)
cur_state = True
prev_state = True
prev_state2 = True

buttonPress = 0
delta = 1

lcd.set_cursor_pos(1, 15)
lcd.print("+")
lcd.set_cursor_pos(0, 0)
lcd.print("BTN is up  ")

while True:
    cur_state2 = btn2.value
    if cur_state2 != prev_state2:
        if not cur_state2:
            delta = -delta #changes delta to negative
            if delta > 0:
                lcd.set_cursor_pos(1, 15)
                lcd.print("+")
            else:
                lcd.set_cursor_pos(1, 15)
                lcd.print("-")
    
    prev_state2 = cur_state2

    cur_state = btn.value
    if cur_state != prev_state:
        if not cur_state:
            buttonPress = buttonPress + delta #depending on delta value button press will have a posotive or negative value added to it
            lcd.set_cursor_pos(0, 0)
            lcd.print("BTN is down")
        else:
            lcd.set_cursor_pos(0, 0)
            lcd.print("BTN is up  ")
        
        lcd.set_cursor_pos(1, 0)
        lcd.print("BTN Press:")
        lcd.print(str(buttonPress))     
        lcd.print(" ")

    prev_state = cur_state
    time.sleep(.05) #delay is .05 of a second

### Wiring


### Reflection
This assignment was very difficult but I managed to do it. It deffinatly taught me a lot about CPython. I got some help from teachers and fellow students as well because I couldent remember how LCDs worked. Ultimatly I wrote my own code but with a lot of help.




## Motor Control

### Description & Code

```import board
import time
from analogio import AnalogOut, AnalogIn
import simpleio

motor = AnalogOut(board.A1)
pot = AnalogIn(board.A0)

while True:
    print(simpleio.map_range(pot.value, 96, 65520, 0, 65535))
    motor.value = int(simpleio.map_range(pot.value, 96, 65520, 0, 65535))
    time.sleep(.1)

### Reflection
I had done this assignmemnt last year so I did not find it too difficult. I still did think however that it was good practice for CPython. Thankfuly I ended up using this code in a later project so it turned out to be usefull.

## Tempreture Sensor

### Description and code

```import board
import analogio
import time
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface

# get and i2c object
i2c = board.I2C()

# some LCDs are 0x3f... some are 0x27.
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)


TMP36_PIN = board.A0  # Analog input connected to TMP36 output.


# Function to simplify the math of reading the temperature.
def tmp36_temperature_C(analogin):
    millivolts = analogin.value * (analogin.reference_voltage * 1000 / 65535)
    return (millivolts - 500) / 10


# Create TMP36 analog input.
tmp36 = analogio.AnalogIn(TMP36_PIN)

# Loop forever.
while True:
    # Read the temperature in Celsius.
    temp_C = tmp36_temperature_C(tmp36)
    # Convert to Fahrenheit.
    temp_F = (temp_C * 9/5) + 32
    # Print out the value and delay a second before looping again.
    print("Temperature: {}C {}F".format(temp_C, temp_F))
    lcd.clear()
    lcd.print("Temperature:\n{:.2f}C {:.2f}F".format(temp_C, temp_F)) # print to LCD with exactly 2 decimal points of precision
    time.sleep(1.0)

### Credit and Reflection
credit to river for most of this code and video. He figured out how it works and also how to run CPython code while its github connnection was down. Even though the code was not mine I did learn a lot from it because it used new ideas I had not seen before.

## Rotary Encoder

### code
again, all credit goes to River with this code. I couldent figure out the Encoder.
```import rotaryio
import board
import digitalio
import neopixel
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface

# get and i2c object
i2c = board.I2C()

# some LCDs are 0x3f... some are 0x27.
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)

led: neopixel.Neopixel = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1) # initialization of hardware
print("neopixel")

led.brightness = 0.1

button = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D12)
button.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
button.pull = digitalio.Pull.UP

colors = [("stop", (255, 0, 0)), ("caution", (128, 128, 0)), ("go", (0, 255, 0))]

encoder = rotaryio.IncrementalEncoder(board.D10, board.D9, 2)
last_position = None
while True:
    position = encoder.position
    if last_position is None or position != last_position:
        lcd.clear()
        lcd.print(colors[position % len(colors)][0])
    if(not button.value):
        led[0] = colors[position % len(colors)][1]
    last_position = position
```

### reflection
This project was difficult to figure out, Using other peoples Githubs was easily the most helpfull part and i doubt i could have completed it without those. Thankful to Grahams Github especially due to its deatiled documentation of this assignment. It also taught me a lot about CPython.

## Photointerruptor

### code
```import time
import digitalio
import board

photoI = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D7)
photoI.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
photoI.pull = digitalio.Pull.UP

last_photoI = True
last_update = -4

photoICrosses = 0

while True:
    if time.monotonic()-last_update > 4:
        print(f"The number of crosses is {photoICrosses}")
        last_update = time.monotonic()
    
    if last_photoI != photoI.value and not photoI.value:
        photoICrosses += 1
    last_photoI = photoI.value
